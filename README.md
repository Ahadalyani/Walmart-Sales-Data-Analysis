# 🛒 Walmart Data Analysis: SQL + Python End-to-End Project 

## 📌 Project Overview

This project delivers a complete data analysis workflow on Walmart sales data. Using **Python** for data processing and **SQL (MySQL & PostgreSQL)** for querying, it uncovers valuable business insights. It’s designed for aspiring data analysts looking to strengthen skills in data wrangling, SQL querying, and pipeline development.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

* **Languages:** Python 3.8+, SQL
* **Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL
* **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `sqlalchemy`, `mysql-connector-python`, `psycopg2`
* **IDE:** Visual Studio Code
* **Other:** Kaggle API for data access

---

## 🚀 Project Pipeline

### 1. Environment Setup

Organize your workspace in **VS Code** with proper folder structure for smooth development and data handling.

### 2. Kaggle API Configuration

* Download `kaggle.json` from your [Kaggle account settings](https://www.kaggle.com/account).
* Place it in the `.kaggle/` folder.
* Download dataset using:

  ```
  kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-name>
  ```

### 3. Dataset Acquisition

* **Source:** [Walmart Sales Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
* Save the dataset under the `/data` directory.

### 4. Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python psycopg2
```

### 5. Load & Explore Data

* Load data into Pandas DataFrames.
* Perform initial exploration using:

  ```python
  df.info(), df.describe(), df.head()
  ```

### 6. Data Cleaning

* Remove duplicates and handle missing values.
* Convert columns to appropriate data types.
* Format currency values.
* Ensure data consistency for analysis.

### 7. Feature Engineering

* Add a new `Total_Amount` column:

  ```
  Total_Amount = Quantity × Unit Price
  ```
* This makes downstream SQL analysis easier.

### 8. Load Cleaned Data into SQL

* Use SQLAlchemy to connect to both **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**.
* Create tables and insert data automatically from Python.
* Run initial verification queries to ensure accurate loading.

### 9. Advanced SQL Analysis

Solve key business questions using SQL:

* Branch/category-wise revenue trends
* Best-selling categories
* Sales patterns by city, time, and payment mode
* Peak hours and customer buying trends
* Profitability across locations

> 🗒️ Each query includes the business goal, SQL logic, and interpreted results.

### 10. Documentation & Publishing

* Add detailed notes in a Jupyter Notebook or Markdown file.
* Upload all project files to **GitHub**, including:

  * `README.md`
  * SQL scripts
  * Python scripts
  * Jupyter notebooks
  * Steps to download data
